## üìà Model Evaluation Summary

To evaluate model performance, this script utilizes a `KNeighborsClassifier` and performs hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation across the datasets. The evaluation results are organized by dataset, providing `AUC` (Area Under the Curve) scores and their standard deviations, giving a clear view of the model‚Äôs effectiveness.
