# 📊 Dataset Summary Generator

## 🚀 Overview
This Python script loads various datasets from popular machine learning repositories, such as `sklearn` and `OpenML`, and generates a comprehensive summary of their characteristics. The results are presented in a well-organized table format using the `tabulate` library, which includes:

- 📂 **Dataset Name**
- 🔢 **Number of Classes** (unique target labels)
- 🧮 **Number of Features**
- 📈 **Number of Numerical Features**
- 🔤 **Number of Categorical Features**
- 📏 **Size of Dataset** (number of instances)

## 📝 Code Explanation

This script provides an efficient way to load, analyze, and summarize the key characteristics of datasets from various sources. Below is a breakdown of each component and its role in the overall functionality:

### 1. Dataset Summarization

The `summarize_dataset()` function is the core of this script, responsible for calculating and gathering essential information about each dataset. It processes datasets in the form of `pandas` DataFrames, making it versatile in handling various data formats. Here's what it includes:

- **Dataset Name**: Retrieves or assigns a human-readable name from metadata or assigns it manually.
- **Number of Classes**: Counts unique classes or labels in the target variable.
- **Number of Features**: Calculates the total count of attributes or columns (excluding the target).
- **Numerical Features**: Counts features with numerical values (e.g., integers, floats).
- **Categorical Features**: Counts non-numeric features (e.g., strings, objects).
- **Dataset Size**: Calculates the number of rows or data instances.

### 2. Loading Datasets

The script utilizes the `load_dataset()` function to fetch datasets from popular libraries like `sklearn` and `OpenML` by using methods suited to each source:

- **From `sklearn`**: Uses `load_iris()` for the Iris dataset, available directly from `sklearn`.
- **From OpenML**: Uses `fetch_openml()` to access datasets by specifying their OpenML IDs.

The `load_dataset()` function includes:

- **Dataset Fetching**: Downloads the dataset from either `sklearn` or `OpenML`.
- **Error Handling**: Anticipates issues such as retrieval errors or data format mismatches and logs messages for debugging.
- **Summarization**: Once loaded, each dataset is passed to `summarize_dataset()` for detail extraction.

### 3. Organizing and Displaying Output

After collecting summaries for each dataset, the script compiles the data into a clean, structured format:

- **Data Aggregation**: Stores all dataset summaries as rows in a `pandas` DataFrame.
- **Formatting with `tabulate`**: Uses `tabulate` to format the DataFrame into a visually appealing table.

## 📋 Example Output

The output generated by the script is displayed as a neatly formatted table, summarizing key information for each dataset. Here is a sample output:
