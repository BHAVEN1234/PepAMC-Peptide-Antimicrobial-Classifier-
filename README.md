Peptide-Antimicrobial-Classifier

An effective classifier built using machine learning techniques to predict and analyze peptide-based antimicrobial activity.

📊 About The Project
This project aims to classify peptides for antimicrobial activity using various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). It employs datasets like Wine and Iris to explore feature selection techniques and model optimization, ensuring reliable antimicrobial predictions.

The classifier is built to assist researchers and developers in identifying potentially useful antimicrobial peptides, providing a crucial tool in the fight against drug-resistant pathogens.
